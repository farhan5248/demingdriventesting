# Is this for you?

You've read some of these books that I've read or listened to these podcasts and you're interested in reading about examples of how they were applied when leading a development team and a QA team

# Why I've made this

During these past 10 years I've never read anyone describe how to transform a QA team. There's information on how to do BDD but not how you get a large QA team to do so with legacy technology like COBOL or unpopular stuff like PL/SQL.

# About me

I've been coding for 15 years. Over the past 10 years, I've led a development team (~20 people) and a QA team (~40 people). I've worked on really large integration projects (20 environments with a single environment having 20, 50 or 200 VM). 

I've gone from doubting to loving TDD/BDD and supporting other developers and testers in adopting it. I'm sharing my experience for the benefit of others just as I benefited from others having done the same. Nowadays I'm working on an example project that anyone can take and build upon.
