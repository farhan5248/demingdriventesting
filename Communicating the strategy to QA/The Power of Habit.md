Establish your next target condition. 
I had read about Paul O'Neil, the CEO of ALCOA and the culture of safety that they had there. 
Changing a culture is changing group habit. The next target was always the next habit to develop. 
It was almost always defining a small change to the standard work along with a way to measure that it's not worse than before. It doesn't have to be better, just not worse.
Everyone had to develop the habit of making a task they did easier for themselves, or another tester, test automator or developer. 
By doing so I felt we'd slowly have more standard work and its benefits or less waste from hand-offs.
