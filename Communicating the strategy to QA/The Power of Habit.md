At this point I know who I will work with initially. I know what skills they have. The fourth thing was what was I going to ask them to do.

I needed small changes with low cognitive load so I had to figure out a small idea that could apply to every aspect of the team's work. I had read about Paul O'Neil, the CEO of ALCOA and the culture of safety that they had there. 

My idea was inspired from a Netflix AWS presentation and so I aimed to create a culture of easy ownership. Everyone had to develop the habit of making a task they did easier for themselves, or another tester, test automator or developer. By doing so I felt we'd slowly have more standard work and its benefits or less waste from hand-offs (transport).
