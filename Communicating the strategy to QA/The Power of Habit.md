# The Power of Habit

Establish your next target condition.

The next target was always the next habit to develop. It was the next small thing they would do regularly.
It was almost always defining a small change to how the work is done and how to measure that it's not worse than before. It doesn't have to be better, just not worse.
I needed small changes with low cognitive load so I had to figure out a small idea that could apply to every aspect of the team's work. 
I had read about Paul O'Neil, the CEO of ALCOA and the culture of safety that they had there. 

My idea was inspired from a Netflix AWS presentation and so I aimed to create a culture of easy ownership. 
Everyone had to develop the habit of making a task they did easier for themselves, or another tester, test automator or developer. 
By doing so I felt we'd slowly have more standard work and its benefits or less waste from hand-offs (transport).
