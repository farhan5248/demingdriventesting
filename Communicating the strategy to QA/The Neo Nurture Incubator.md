# The Neo Nurture Incubator

Grasp the current condition. I had to start with the skills people already had and come up with creative ways to build on that. 
The state of things was such that nobody had time to learn any other skills. 

I took inspiration from the [NeoNurture Incubator](https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2029497_2030618_2029499,00.html). Long story short, when it broke down, nobody could fix it because they didn't have the skills. 
So the designers made an incubator that looked it was made out of car parts. 
Why? Because the folks in that country were very good at fixing their cars and keeping them running for years. 
After the design change, anytime the part that looked like a headlight broke, they could walk out onto the street and ask someone to come in and fix it. 
Basically they made the problem look like another problem which folks knew how to solve.

The COBOL testing team had a Java SWING program (somebatchtool.jar) that converted Microsoft Word documents into text files. 
These text files were either CPHA3 claim requests or upload files with data about new certificate holders and drugs etc. 
Instead of trying to get folks to use Cucumber and teach them about Gherkin and stories etc, I worked with Word and somebatchtool.jar. 
I asked them what problems they ran into and kept fixing those by wrapping the entire process within a custom Maven plug-in.
Then I showed this way of working to the non-COBOL testers and defined it as the standard that we'd work towards.
This was almost like keyword driven testing but closer to the Ubiquitous language in Domain Driven Design.
