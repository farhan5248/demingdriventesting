# Communicating the strategy to QA

The goal shouldn't be to have BDD or CICD, they'll come about gradually, it's to create a culture of continuous improvement. 
As my QA team culture changed, they and the COBOL developers learnt through kaizen that the QA team's tests driving the developers code changes was the better way of working for both of them and then I told them that's called BDD. 

The opposite is telling everyone we're doing BDD. They'll go online and read about a tool called Cucumber with a programming language called Java. The testers will say they can't code and so will everyone else. The developers will say they can code but only in COBOL. Your transformation dies right there. 

All of the work done by both teams was done with no restructuring of the teams, no budget for the training and no delays to the release schedule, just dozens of kaizen for 3-4 years.
