title: Communicating the strategy to QA
---

The goal shouldn't be to have BDD or CICD, they'll come about gradually, it's to create a culture of continuous improvement and easy ownership. 
As my QA team culture changed, they and the COBOL developers learnt through kaizen that the QA team's tests driving the developers code changes was the better way of working for both of them and then I told them that's called BDD. All of the work done by both teams was done with no restructuring of the teams, no budget for the training and no delays to the release schedule, just dozens of kaizen for 3-4 years. 

The opposite is telling everyone we're doing BDD. They'll go online and read about a tool called Cucumber with a programming language called Java. The testers will say they can't code and so might everyone else. The developers will say they can code but only in COBOL. My transformation would have died right there.
