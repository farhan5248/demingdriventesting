I like this video for a few reasons. I learnt about Prezi which was great for communicating with my team :) but also it gives examples of what and what not to aim for.
The best part is at minute 42:13 where he provides an explanation that I use to answer why should an organisation invest in testers who can't program.

Instead of getting testers to learn to program or getting test automation developers to automate tests, use a [language workbench with a DSL][1].
This way you make minimal changes to how testers write their test cases and minimal changes to how developers prefer to run their unit tests.
