# Why run the QA tests earlier

I was asked this question a lot. 
I assumed most folks who asked me that question knew that finding and fixing a defect earlier costs less which they did.
However, there was this belief that executing an end-to-end test was more efficient and so overall it would cost less to run those.
Other times, I was told they tried BDD or trying to test earlier but it slowed them down or was unsustainable.

I decided to leave the QA team when I was finally able to answer these questions with data from my QA team and the COBOL development team.
