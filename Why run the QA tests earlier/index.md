# Why run the QA tests earlier

I was asked this question a lot. 
I assumed most folks who asked me that question knew that finding and fixing a defect earlier costs less which they did.
However, there was this belief that executing an end-to-end test was more efficient and so overall it would cost less to run those.
Other times, I was told they tried BDD or trying to test earlier but it slowed them down or was unsustainable.

1. [Does running the QA team tests during coding slow developers down?]
2. [Does it matter if the tests actually drive the development?]
