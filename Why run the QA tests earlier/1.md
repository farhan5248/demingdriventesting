# Does running the QA team tests during coding slow developers down?

During the 4.5 years I was leading my team and working with the COBOL developers to run the QA tests in their development environments, they were never slowed down.
Even the development managers of those developers could see no indication of any slow down and they did nothing to speed it up either.

In fact, it actually sped up the development process.
In my second last year there was a 6 month release.
The dev team wanted 4-5 months to code and my team had estimated 4-5 months to execute the tests.
This meant that we needed almost 9 months to do the work but only had 6.
Thankfully by this point in time my team could recognise that this was the same problem as constructing the Empire State building.

The solution to which was to overlap phases which we did.
In the end, the developers got the 4-5 months they asked for.
My testers wrote and tested the code along side the developers as early as the second month in their development environment.
The code was delivered into QA in the 5th month and soon after all the tests were run within a day and we then ran the regression.
We were done somewhere in the middle of the 6th month.

Even though the tests were run in a day by the time the code got to QA I should add some notes

1. The process of creating the setup data took days, because of all the new Java web-app code that had to be tested first and was buggy.
2. One developer took longer to deliver the code to QA but still took less time overall because she had no bug fixes. More on this below.
3. The regression for some reason was not run in the lower environments even though it could have been, I can't recall why it wasn't done.

So how was this possible?
