I figured I'd make this summary for anyone unfamiliar with Dr Deming.
You can Google him and visit the [Deming Institute site](https://deming.org/) but I wanted to cover his relevance to software development and QA especially.

How did I come across him? As I mentioned in the [About](/about) section his name kept coming up when I started my research around 2018.
It was mainly in books but the last source was the site which explained the term shift left using the burnt toast analogy.

On his Profound Podcast, John Willis often says it all goes back to Deming. 
If you listen to Dr Steven Spear, Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Dave Farley, the Poppendiecks, they'll talk about Lean, Toyota or [NUMMI](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/nummi-2015). 
You can read about the relationship between Dr Deming and Toyota [here](https://deming.org/toyotas-management-history/)

Andrew Clay Shafer is one of the people who coined the phrase DevOps. 
He's directly referenced Dr Deming in his presentations. I'm not sure which of these two videos it is but I like them both so I'll put both links here.
1. [More Buzzwords Won't Help: The Long History of DevOps Failures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8hma_YSBX0&t=3s)
2. [SRE as She Is Spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5yIUkJTzw8&t=1011s)

The [Sys-Tao site has some good links](https://sys-tao.org/links/), these are about Dr Deming.
1. [If Japan Can, Why Can't We?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcG_Pmt_Ny4)
2. [W. Edwards Deming - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHvnIm9UEoQ)

You can find the list of 14 points [here](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points/). 
I've put some comments on the ones that applied to my QA team.
11 and 12 have two parts, I only put the part that I could apply.
The same goes for point 4, I didn't attempt to apply that.

1. Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.
2. Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.
3. Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.
5. Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
6. Institute training on the job.
7. Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.
8. Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.
9. Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service.
10. Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.
11. Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership.
12. Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.
13. Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.
14. Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.
