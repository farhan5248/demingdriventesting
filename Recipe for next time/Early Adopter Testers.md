title: Early Adopter Testers
---

Run the Maven plug-in to do offline validation of the test cases by converting them to AsciiDoc. The goal is to identify early adopters and innovators before asking them to change. Some testers are very detailed oriented and meticulous, some are not. We want the former to be volunteers first since it's easier for them to generate automation. Introduce the regex to validate their test steps gradually. Invite the testers to volunteer to see how valid their test cases are. What if there are no test cases stored in files but Jira? Use the web-services to get them.
