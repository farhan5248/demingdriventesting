It's been 7 years since I joined the QA team. If I had to do it again, here's what I think I'd do.

1. [Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation](Motivation)
2. [Should you break-up your QA team](Team)
4. [Identify early adopters](Early%20Adopters)
2. [Install the tools](Install%20Tools)
3. [Remove admin toil](Remove%20Admin%20Toil)
6. [Upskill the testers](Upskilling%20Testers)
7. [Involve the Developers](Involving%20Developers)
8. [Automate test planning](Planning%20Automation)
