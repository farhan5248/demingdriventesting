It's been 7 years since I joined the QA team. If I had to do it again, here's what I think I'd do.

1. [Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation][1]
2. [Should you break-up your QA team][2]
4. [Identify early adopters][3]
2. [Install the tools][4]
3. [Remove admin toil][5]
6. [Upskill the testers][6]
7. [Involve the Developers][7]
8. [Automate test planning][8]
