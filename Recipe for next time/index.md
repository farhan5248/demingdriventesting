# Recipe for next time

The last thing before we could begin was how to go about making changes.  On a large scale, I explained the gravity slingshot strategy of chasing after achievable goals based on the skills we have, then gathering momentum and picking a bigger goal. However I needed to give guidance on how to apply that on a daily basis. That's where Mike Rother's Improvement Kata came in.

1. Get the direction or challenge: We want to become a Quality Assistance team. We will make it easier for developers to own the execution of our test cases such that we assist them build defect free code. We'll do this by having a culture of easy ownership so we can swarm to solve problems and collectively free up our team's time and having a culture of continuous improvement where we keep looking for better ways of working.
2. Grasp the current condition: Is there a standard? Are we following it?
3. Establish your next target condition: Define the small change to how the work is done and how to measure that it's not worse than before. It doesn't have to be better, just not worse.
4. Conduct experiments to get there. This is where the Kaizen come in. Sometimes it was automation (Jidoka), sometimes it was mistake prevention (poka-yoke) and other times it was just eliminating the need for the task.
