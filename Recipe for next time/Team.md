title: Should you break-up your QA team
---

I'll write more later bu short answer is No. I didn't and it worked out just well.
I originally went to the QA team with the intention to do so but realised I didn't need to.

Later on I came across Team of Teams when I was listening to [Matthew Skelton on the Engineering Roo]().
I think Team of Teams describes why you don't need to break up your QA team.
I think you'd keep the Platform (API/Service thing we created in my team), Enabling (folks who trained people in my team) and Complex (testers with specialised knowledge like a specialist surgeon roaming between hospitals) in the one QA team and then all the generalist testers can either be moved out or not.

What really mattered was the culture, the relationships between the COBOL developers and testers.
Their managers weren't helpful or supportive and in fact were against the change in practice (on paper they were all for it).
I remember one of the Java development teams manager actually said that COBOL had a technological advantage over Java which is why this earlier testing was possible.
What the COBOL folks did have as an advantage was this great relationship of trust and respect between developers and testers which is why we make it that far.
