# Team Topologies

The popular idea at the time when I joined the QA team was to break up the centralised QA teams.
That is, the testers should be embedded into the development teams.
I was OK with that though I remember thinking to myself that if you say everyone has ownership of something, you typically wind up with nobody owning it. 
Also how would you do an E2E test for large integrated systems? Regardless, I figured I'd just get started and figure out that problem later.

After Team Toplogies came out I could express what I had in mind better. I was going to divide up my QA teams into 3 types. My QA team was onboard since we were evolving in that direction anyways.
1. Generalist full-stack testers on stream aligned teams. These were folks who like to learn new things and have breadth of knowledge.
2. Testers whose depth of knowledge couldn't be confined to one team. They'd be in the central complex subsystem team. They'd learn to use MBT tools to support the stream aligned teams.
3. Test automation developers part of a central enabling team going around helping folks improve.
