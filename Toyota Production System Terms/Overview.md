# Overview

I refer to the Toyota Production System (TPS) and not lean because like other buzz words I find descriptions of lean in the context of software development that don't align with my understanding. That is, they leave out the respect for people part and are too focused on the metrics. 
My focus was primarily on people and their interactions instead of tools and processes though the latter did help. 
These are some of the terms and their definitions I taught my team.
