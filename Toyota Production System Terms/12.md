# Kaizen

I realised that when someone had an idea, they thought they needed to ask for permission because amongst other reasons it'll take time and cause a delay or it might have negative impacts. The smaller the change and negative impact, the less likely one is to ask for permission before trying something. If it becomes infinitely small, which is basically the status quo, nobody asks permission to keep working the same way. I told them a kaizen is making a change so small that it barely registers as a change.

So I'd sit with early adopter volunteers and see how they worked and initially make suggestions myself to demonstrate what I meant by a small change. Then during my weekly meetings with pairs of folks, I'd ask them what small things they thought I could automate for them. If there was something they could do without automation, that was fine too.

Initially most of the changes were Jidoka. An example is instead of opening the Java desktop app and clicking on buttons to convert a Word document to test setup data, I wrapped the inner jar in Maven as a custom plug-in. All they had to do was supply some parameters and run the .bat file
