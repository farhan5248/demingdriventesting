# Standard Work

Before changing anything by making it faster or eliminating anything, we needed a standard. 
Standardising the work was an informal way of developing a Value Stream Map. 
I tried to gradually understand the whole system of work through informal conversations. 
Though there were standards, there was almost a different way of working for each tester. 

As we made kaizens, we documented them as they became part of the new standard. 
What I didn't do is blindly document everything or try to map everything.
Instead the map developed organically as we improved.

How much did we document, like to what level of detail?
There was enough detail such that individuals could follow the improvement journey of their peers at their own pace with minimal (not none) guidance. 
They also had to be short enough that one could do whenever they had down time here and there like a simple checklist of 10 steps to installing Eclipse. 

Another use for standardising the work was to compare improvements. 
It wasn't the case that everybody can just change whatever they wanted, that would be chaos. 
Each time someone wanted to change something, they needed to make a hypotheses that compared their idea to the  standard. 
Without a standard, it would be like running a test without a baseline which they understood.
