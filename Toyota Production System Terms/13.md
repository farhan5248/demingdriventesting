# Standard Work

Before changing anything by making it faster or eliminating anything, we needed a standard. Standardising the work was an informal way of developing a Value Stream Map. I tried to gradually understand the whole system of work through these conversations. Though there were  standards, there was almost a different way of working for each tester. As we made kaizens, we documented them as they became part of the new standard. 

By ensuring anyone could follow the instructions, individuals could follow the improvement journey of their peers at their own pace with minimal guidance. These were little things one could do whenever they had down time here and there. Each piece of documentation had to be a simple checklist like 10 steps to installing Eclipse. Each time, I got feedback from them and then improved the steps so that anyone could follow it. 

Another use for standardising the work was to compare improvements. It wasn't the case that everybody can just change whatever they wanted, that would be chaos. Each time someone wanted to change something, they needed to make a hypotheses that compared their idea to the  standard. Without a standard, it would be like running a performance test without a baseline.
