# Introduction

The goal of this site and supporting code is to describe my experiences through stories about the QA team I led. 
I've explained more [here](https://farhan5248.github.io/About) but at a high level, there's two themes to the stories, the process and the outcome.

1. Process: I applied Toyota Production System concepts or Dr Deming's System of Profound Knowledge and the Improvement Kata (Mike Rother) to a QA team. Eventually the testers were running their automated tests alongside developers in lower environments so that quality was built-in. The result was that almost all QA end-to-end tests were run as component tests before the code was delivered to the QA environment and was virtually defect-free.
2. Outcome: I used the Ubiquitous language described in DDD by Eric Evans in a QA team. When I joined none of the testers writing tests automated any of them. In the end, all tests were written in the language using the [Xtext framework](https://eclipse.dev/Xtext/) from which test automation could be generated by querying the API. This was like having an API to browse through all the tests written by the team, manual or automated.
