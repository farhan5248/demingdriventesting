# Sheep Dog Blog

The goal of this site and supporting code is to describe my experiences about applying lean principles and practices to the QA team I led. 
I've explained more [here](https://farhan5248.github.io/About).
A summary of the supporting repositories and projects is [here](https://farhan5248.github.io/RepositoriesAndProjects).

Why Sheep Dog? I'm a dog person and when I heard [Ryan Tierney (Lean Made Simple podcast)](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxesmBzvq8mTLdD9ATv4epw1bAVDz6Ln6x?si=LrO6ScEXzI4-VbAV) use the sheep dog analogy, it resonated with me. 
Basically if you send in a bulldog to do the job, it runs into the middle of the flock barking and disrupting everything. 
With a sheep dog, you never see it; you see the grass around the sheep move, you see the sheep move and everything happens quietly and peacefully. 
When I thought about how to transform my team, I realised heroic effort was unsustainable and big bang changes were bound to be too much effort. 
Instead it had to be this gradual organic evolution of our ways of working similar to a sheep dog moving a flock. 
This approach was inspired by the Improvement Kata which is described in Mike Rother's book, Toyota Kata.
