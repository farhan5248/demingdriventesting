# Maginot Line

I realised that the pipeline was built for a purpose that was no longer required just like the Maginot line. It was designed to make deploys into existing environments fast and mistake-proof given its size and complexity because those were the most time consuming activities in the past. 

What it should have been designed for is to make it easier to stand-up individual components. Then you could have just one component on your laptop or all of them in an environment. Docker makes it easier to solve this problem but I don't think you always need containers to solve the problem. Later on when working with my testers and COBOL developers, I could see that if you ran the QA tests in advance, you didn't need that many deploys, so even if you do it manually as they did you'd be OK. 

Eventually my manager asked me to work with the developer and take all the QA tests and automate them using SOAPUI and run them in advance and deploy the code one last time.  Sadly we still had to wait because the QA team was doing everything manually. To them, automation was something that could only be done at the end after all tests had been run manually; I didn't understand why. What I did get at this point is that getting that feedback earlier through automated tests was a smaller price to pay than the cost of the re-work in both mine and the QA team.
