# Team Topologies

At some point, the QA director and manager were no longer with the company. My director inherited the QA teams and so I convinced him to give my manager and I control of those teams. I noticed that the QA managers under this director had practices that didn't align with CICD or DevOps principles or practices. The belief was that CICD or DevOps were just developer toys to play with and they weren't interested in the conversation.

The popular idea at the time was to break up the centralised QA teams so this could be achieved. I was OK with that though I remember thinking to myself that if you say everyone has ownership of something, you typically wind up with nobody owning it. Also how would you do an E2E test for large integrated systems? Regardless, I figured I'd just get started and figure out that problem later.

After Team Toplogies came out I could express what I had in mind better. I was going to divide up my QA teams into 3 types. My QA team was onboard since we were evolving in that direction anyways.
1. Generalist full-stack testers on stream aligned teams. These were folks who like to learn new things and have breadth of knowledge.
2. Testers whose depth of knowledge couldn't be confined to one team. They'd be in the central complex subsystem team. They'd learn to use MBT tools to support the stream aligned teams.
3. Test automation developers part of a central enabling team going around helping folks improve.
