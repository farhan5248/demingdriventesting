# Seeing the problem in Dev

Except for the very end of my time on my last dev team, my main focus was having a CICD pipeline. Towards the end, I realised that I needed BDD (TDD with QA). To be honest, I didn't know what Continuous Delivery was as Dave Farley explains it. To me it was automated deployments, testing was something QA did, my job was to get the code to them as quickly as possible so they could tell me what I did wrong :). Interestingly, where I worked nobody really argued with this view. If testing was slow, that was QA's job to make it go faster, developers just had to code and get it to QA on time. I should add that I rarely got anything wrong, thanks to heroic effort to memorise the code base, an unsustainable practice in hindsight as I got older :P
