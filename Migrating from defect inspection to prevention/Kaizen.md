# Kaizen

I realised that when someone had an idea, they thought they needed to ask for permission.
I assume it was because amongst other reasons they thought it'll take time and cause a delay or it might have negative impacts. 
The smaller the change and negative impact, the less likely one is to ask for permission before trying something. 
If it becomes infinitely small, which is basically the status quo, nobody asks permission to keep working the same way. 
I told them a kaizen is making a change so small that it barely registers as a change.

So I'd sit with early adopter volunteers and see how they worked and initially make suggestions myself to demonstrate what I meant by a small change. 
Then during my weekly meetings with pairs of folks, I'd ask them what small things they thought I could automate for them. 
If there was something they could do without automation, that was fine too.
