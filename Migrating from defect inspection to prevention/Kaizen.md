# Kaizen

Initially when someone had an idea to improve, they thought they needed to ask for permission.
I assume it was because amongst other reasons they thought it'll take time and cause a delay or it might have negative impacts. 
The smaller the change and negative impact, the less likely one is to ask for permission before trying something. 
If it becomes infinitely small, which is basically the status quo, nobody asks permission to keep working the same way. 
If they felt they needed to ask me for permission it was too big a change.

I told them a kaizen is making a change so small that it barely registers as a change.
So I'd sit with early adopter volunteers and see how they worked and initially make suggestions myself to demonstrate what I meant by a small change. 
Then during my weekly meetings with pairs of folks, I'd ask them what small things they thought I could automate for them. 
If there was something they could do without automation, that was fine too.

An example of a non-automation improvement had to do with a full-stack or generalist tester.
In the entire team, each individual only tested one component.
If an end-to-end test was needed, it required co-ordination between team-leads of those teams and their testers.
If that's not already a waste of time, there was a duplication of testing efforts.
For example, to adjudicate a claim you need to setup data in one component and adjudicate it in another.
So one tester would test just data setup.
Another tester would then use the same component to setup their data to adjudicate the claim.
If the helpdesk app tester had to test a change to that app, they'd do the job of the first two!
Gradually as the language was developed and there was less assumed knowledge needed for writing or executing test cases, an individual could test all three components.
This eliminated the need for meetings or the duplication of test steps.
