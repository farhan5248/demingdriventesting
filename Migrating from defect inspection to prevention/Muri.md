Overburden

> **Note:**  
> Some testers increased the scope of their testing if they didn't find enough bugs.  
> There was this culture that the good testers find bugs.  
> So if someone didn't find any bugs, they felt they need to fill their bugs found quota.  
> This was easy for me, I just told them I didn't care about finding bugs because quality can't be inspected in.  
> I wonder how many QA directors/managers/leaders actually realise that?  
> After I left, I'm told, they were told to record how many tests they ran everyday and what percentage they automated.  
> I'm told this instruction from the top, like the C-suite but without any explanation why.
