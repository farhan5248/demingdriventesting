title: Migrating from defect inspection to prevention

I sometimes refer to the Toyota Production System (TPS) and not lean because like other terms I find descriptions of lean in the context of software development that don't align with my understanding. 
That is, they leave out the respect for people part and are too focused on the metrics. 
As stated in the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) my focus was primarily on *individuals and interactions over processes and tools, that is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more*.

The previous version of this page was a collection of TPS related terms.
I wasn't sure in what order to present them but tried to do so in the order which I introduced them to my team.
Recently I came across [this episode of the Shop Floor](https://open.spotify.com/episode/14Nbr9nPnIhBYsYlXJY3xI).
I like the way [Chris Roser](https://www.allaboutlean.com/christoph-roser/) has explained things because it aligns with what I remember.
I've made notes [in the blog](/sheepdogblog/shop-floor/2025/07/24/creating-pull-in-your-factory) with links back to detailed examples here.
